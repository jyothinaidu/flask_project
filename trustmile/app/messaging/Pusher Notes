Pusher Notes

The normal case is a user attempts to start a conversation with a person who's name is on their card.

They click a button to say "Start a conversation with Mary, it says she's received my package"

The device sends an API request to our server saying "/conversation/ POST" with user details of other person.

How this would integrate with Pusher is interesting.

When they do the post we could submit a couple of triggers through to pusher:
    1. create a new channel called mary_james_conversation_uniqueid
    2. Notify another channel to which all devices are connected to say "new_event_mary_james_channel_created"
       and the only people who care about his is mary and james. This could have an device id in the name,
       and the device only subscribes to this new channel if it matches their device id.
       On our backend, we need to provide for authentication via the /pusher/authenticate endpoint and that would need
       lookup if the user who is subscribing to this new channel the initiator.
